Gabriel Daniel Fahrenheit was?;All of the above;a German Physicist;developed the mercury thermometer in 1714;devised temperature scale
Radiocarbon is produced in the atmosphere as a result of..?;collision between fast neutrons and nitrogen nuclei present in the atmosphere;action of ultraviolet light from the sun on atmospheric oxygen;action of solar radiations particularly cosmic rays on carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere;lightning discharge in atmosphere
Large transformers, when used for some time, become very hot and are cooled by circulating oil. The heating of the transformer is due to?;both the heating effect of current and hysteresis loss;intense sunlight at noon;hysteresis loss alone;the heating effect of current alone
Mirage is due to?;unequal heating of different parts of the atmosphere;magnetic disturbances in the atmosphere;depletion of ozone layer in the atmosphere;equal heating of different parts of the atmosphere
Planets do not twinkle because?;they are nearer to earth and hence we receive a greater amount of light and, therefore minor variations in the intensity are not noticeable;they are very far away from the earth resulting in decrease in intensity of light;their distance from the earth does not change with time;they emit light of a constant intensity
Out of the following pairs, choose the pair in which the physical quantities do not have identical dimension?;Impulse and moment of force;Force and rate of change of linear momentum;Planck's constant and Angular momentum;Pressure and Young's modules
