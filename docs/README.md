			This is the README file of The Helpless Gooses' Millionare game.

This game is developed by Gell√©rt Sztankovszky based on a team work 
week of the Helpless Gooses Team.
The aim of this development is self-entertainment and learning 
python/programming.

What is it?

	It's a game based on the TV show "Who wants to be a Millionaire?".
	You will get 15 questions in a random order, and you have to choose the 
	correct answer out of 4.

How it works / instrucitons:

	You have to type for every question: a / b / c / d

You have 3 kinds of helps:
	Audience'help
	Telephone help
	Halving the questions by the computer

If you choose an incorrect answer you will instantly lose the game.

The prize that you bring home depends on your performance.
  - You earn guaranteed prize after the 5th correct question.
  - You earn guaranteed prize after the 10th correct question.
  - You earn guaranteed prize after the 15th correct question.


You can also make a guess out of the game to win guaranteed prizes.

And you win the game of course, if you've guessed all the answers correct.

Future goals:

	A game script, that can be executed instantly from a file in a separate window.
	Hungarian and English language selection.


 Please enjoy!
 Best wishes from the Gooses!
